# MMMMobileAlerts

Documentation about the protocols of ELV Mobile Alerts sensors plus a node MQTT gateway

NOTE:
Modified this mobile alerts to create a docker package for my home assistant docker container distribution being run in an arm64v8 machine.
It has not been optimized so its quite big but it works.

# Mobile Alerts

This document tries to describe every detail of the Mobile Alerts sensors, which are sold by [ELV](https://www.elv.de/ip-wettersensoren-system.html) in Germany, but are also available at the common suspects (Amazon, etc). Be careful buying at Amazon: certain sensors mention Mobile Alerts, but seem to be designed for the US. They are _not_ compatible with the ELV Mobile Alerts ones!

Mobile Alerts is covering mostly climate sensors, but also contains moisture and door/window sensors plus a sound detector, which acts as a gateway for smoke sensors.

The [Mobile Alerts](http://www.mobile-alerts.eu) are a version of the [LaCrosse Alerts Mobile](http://www.lacrossetechnology.com/alerts/) system made for the European market.
